### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: **What does the trend of U.S. presidents’ inaugural speeches reflect?**
+ This project is conducted by **Xiaoxiao Guo** *(xg2282)*

+ Project summary: The main question of this research is to analyse the trend of presidents’ inaugural speeches according to the 58 inaugural speeches we have from 1789-2017 and think about what these changes reflect. Specifically, this project analyzes the following three aspects:

  1. Change in length of sentences in presidents’ inaugural speeches
  2. Change in speakers’ emotions with presidents’ inaugural speeches
  3. Change in topics of presidents’ inaugural speeches
  
+ Findings:
From my study, I will draw a conclusion that the trend of presidents’ speeches from 1789 to 2017 reflects the development of our human behaviours and thoughts:

  1. Sentences become shorter than before, which implies that people are pursuing an simpler way to express themselves.
  2. Less radical in sentiment means people now can control their emotion well and can always keep calm. In addition, people now become more possitive than before.
  3. Topic change of speeches reflects our thoughts. It shows what kind of life we are living in or we want to live in.
